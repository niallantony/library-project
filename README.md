# library-project

The library project started as a way to learn how to control DOM elements with Javascript. The initial version of this website used a clumsy system to store books as objects in an array, and fill the forms with information, storing whichever object was currently active as an ID number which referenced its index in the array, and then performing actions upon that object by adjusting the array.

With the latest version each book was created using classes and a constructor, and the methods (for deletion, editing) were built into the book object class. While better I still think there is room for improvement later. However the act of going back over old code and implementing new features I have learnt is incredibly helpful for me and I feel like I have learnt a lot.
